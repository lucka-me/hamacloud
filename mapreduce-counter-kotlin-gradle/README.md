# mapreduce-counter-kotlin-gradle

A Hadoop MapReduce implement for word counting, written in Kotlin with IntelliJ IDEA and built with Gradle.

The `.jar` file generated by IJ will not include Hadoop libraries.

## Requirement
- Library (`.jar` files) of Apache Hadoop 3.2.0

## Build
1. In `build.gradle`:
    1. If `System.getenv()` could return the correct path in your os, use it instead of plain string
    2. In `jar {}`, paste the required paths inside `from(zipTree(""))`
2. Open the Gradle panel on the right side, execute `Tasks - build - jar` and the `.jar` file will be located at `build/libs`
3. Send the `.jar` to Hadoop server and run it
